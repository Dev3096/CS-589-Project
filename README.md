# CS-589-Project-Description

The goal of this project is to test GasPump class that exhibits state behavior specified by the 
EFSM model. The GasPump class is a state-based class that is used to control a simple gas 
pump. Users can pay by cash or with a credit card. The gas pump disposes three types of 
gasoline: Regular, Super, and Midgrade. The price of each type of gasoline is provided when 
the gas pump is activated.
In this project the goal is to test the provided implementation (source code) of the GasPump 
class. The following testing methods are used:
1) Model-Based Testing
2) Default Transition Testing
3) Multiple Condition Testing
